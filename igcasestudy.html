      Instagram Stories lets Instagram accounts post photos and videos that
      vanish after 24 hours. Stories were launched in August 2016, and now more
      than 500 million Instagrammers use stories daily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like adding effects to your photos, Instagram has story effects made by
      users of the app or Instagram itself for adding filters/effects onto your
      stories
    </p>

    <p>
      The main problem I found after interviewing my friends was that it was
      difficult to locate the Instagram story effects with the current User
      Interface, this makes it hard for people to fully enjoy the feature
    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted to find ways to enhance the User Experience when using Instagram
      stories. From using Instagram stories and from observing friends use it, I
      realised that there were a few personal favourite effects that each
      individual tends to use very often. Hence solution 3 which allows users to
      easily find their last used filter(s).<br />
      While trying to find a filter it is hard to see how the filter will look
      with the photo that the user wants to use hence proposing solution 2 which
      shows a variety of filters and is easy to visualise. <br />
      Lastly solution 1 was an easy way to allow users to put the filters into
      categories which they are able to name themselves so that they are able to
      find what filter they are looking for instead of typing the filter's
      unique name.
